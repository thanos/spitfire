# spitfire

## Introduction
Spitfire is a template language heavily inspired by Cheetah. It started out as an experiment to see if techniques from the compiler world were applicable to the mundane details of templates.

At this point, Spitfire works - at least in theory. There are basic tests cases that assure templates parse, compile, generate and execute correctly. Most language features are covered with a high-level test, though it is possible that there are some bugs or shortcomings in the syntax.
